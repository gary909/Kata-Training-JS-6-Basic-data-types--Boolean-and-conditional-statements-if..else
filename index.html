    <title>Training JS #6: Basic data types--Boolean and conditional statements if..else</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>
        In javascript, Boolean object only has two value, true or false. Use ===, ==, >, <, >=, <= between two variables(or constant), <br>
        the result of such an expression is a bool value. The operation between the two bool values can be used with logical <br>
        operators:&&, ||, ! or some bitwise operators:&, |, ^<br>
<br>
        Many of the data are likely to be implicitly converted to Boolean values in a given context, most common in conditional <br>
        statements. In other words, the Boolean value is mainly used for conditional judgment. Look this example:<br>
<br>
        var arr=[];<br>
        ...<br>
        ...<br>
        ......<br>
        if (arr.length) return "arr has elements";<br>
        else            return "arr is empty";<br>
        You can see, arr is defined as an array, arr.length should be a number value, but in this example, the number value should <br>
        convert to bool value. it means, if arr.length value is 0, convert value to false, if arr.length value is not 0, convert value to true.<br>
<br>
        These values are converted to false in the conditional statement:<br>
<br>
        0, -0, "", null, undefined, NaN<br>
        Task<br>
        Coding in function trueOrFalse, function accept 1 parameters:val, try to use the conditional statement if...else, if val <br>
        value is false (val==false or it can convert to false), should return a string "false", if not, return a string "true".<br>
<br>
        When you have finished the work, click "Run Tests" to see if your code is working properly.<br>
<br>
        In the end, click "Submit" to submit your code pass this kata.<br>
